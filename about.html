                    <p>The Arnhem Postal History Project (APH) is a digital public history project that makes available
                        to the public for the first time over 5,000 individual letters and postcards circulated inside
                        and
                        outside the Netherlands between 1939 and 1945. The collection is a critical one for
                        understanding the everyday lives of the Dutch during WWII through postal history. The

                        collection provides important insights into key moments on the Dutch front, including the
                        invasion of Holland, the emergence of the Holocaust in Holland, Operation Market Garden and
                        the resulting Hunger Winter, where tens of thousands of Dutch civilians were intentionally
                        starved by the Nazis.</p>

                    <p>Letters provide direct firsthand, contemporaneous records of the social impact of World War 2
                        and the brutal battles that are now so well known to many. The post was the primary means of
                        communication in a pre-cell phone world. Citizens relied on the post to provide news on
                        extended family members. The post does this very well. The Dutch post office kept meticulous
                        records and we know in detail when each item of mail went from one location to another.</p>
                    
                    <p> Postal artifacts provide a tangible connection and different perspective to events that may
                        already be well-known to many. Almost by definition, every postal artifact includes information
                        on the sender as well as the recipient; who sent it and to whom, and the cover is inscribed with
                        precise information about the date and even the time of day that it was sent and the timing and
                        route that it took until delivered (or otherwise handled). As such the post provides a vibrant,
                        contemporaneous testament to the experiences of the Dutch people and the combatants on
                        both sides. Importantly, these artifacts were there when these tumultuous events occurred.
                        They are not digital representations or recreations, but these scraps of paper with the senders
                        handwriting were actually present when these events took place. </p>
                    
                    <p> However, handwritten notes, letters and even books, are fast being replaced by a digital world,
                        with seemingly unlimited amounts of information (and disinformation) available on demand.
                        While the digital is infinitely reproducible, the older analog world is fast losing its remaining
                        artifacts with fewer and fewer replacements available. This project focuses at the junction of
                        the analog and the digital and establishes an interactive “journey” where students and others
                        can follow an authentic but very “old world” analog postal artifact, as it travels through the
                        Dutch countryside and the war. </p>

                            <p> Handwritten notes, letters, and even books are fast being replaced in a digital world,

                                enthusiasts, among which I include myself, spend hours researching the arcane details of
                                individual
                                soldiers’ experiences in specific rooms at houses dotted around Arnhem and the near-by
                                village of
                                Oosterbeek. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the experience of the
                                civilians
                                impacted by the Battle of Arnhem and the war.

                            <p>I did not set out to become a philatelist. In 2019, a life-long friend, who is a renowned
                                philatelist,
                                gave me a single “cover” addressed to Mevrouw (Mrs.) B. Haartsen-Heeck at Utrechtsweg
                                69,
                                Oosterbeek,
                                dated 25 September 1944. It started me thinking about the experiences of the lady whose
                                home was
                                located
                                right on the front line of the battle between the 1st British Airborne Division and
                                assorted
                                German
                                forces.</p>

                        <p>My “pandemic project” has now grown into a collection of over 6,000 postal items sent

                            Holland
                            during the five years of war (1940-1945). Clearly, not all items within our collection are
