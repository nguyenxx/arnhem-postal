                <p>
                    My name is Tim Gale and I am the Director of the Arnhem Postal History (APH) project, a non-profit
                    entity based in the United States of America. The APH project examines the intersection of social
                    and
                    military history and the role of the postal service during the Battle of Arnhem, and more broadly
                    World
                    War 2 in Holland. Postal artifacts provide direct firsthand, contemporaneous records of the social
                    impact of the brutal battle that is now so well known to many.

            <div class="row d-flex align-item-center">

                <p> Handwritten notes, letters, and even books are fast being replaced in a digital world, with
                    seemingly
                    unlimited amounts of information (and disinformation) available on demand. While the digital is
                    infinitely reproducible, the older analog world is fast losing its remaining artifacts with fewer
                    and
                    fewer original sources available. It is our intention to focus on the junction of the analog and the
                    digital and establish an interactive “journey” where students and others can follow authentic but
                    very
                    “old world” analog postal artifacts, as they travel through the Dutch countryside. Whole communities
                    of
                    enthusiasts, among which I include myself, spend hours researching the arcane details of individual
                    soldiers’ experiences in specific rooms at houses dotted around Arnhem and the near-by village of
                    Oosterbeek. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the experience of the civilians
                    impacted by the Battle of Arnhem and the war.

                <p>I did not set out to become a philatelist. In 2019, a life-long friend, who is a renowned
                    philatelist,
                    gave me a single “cover” addressed to Mevrouw (Mrs.) B. Haartsen-Heeck at Utrechtsweg 69,
                    Oosterbeek,
                    dated 25 September 1944. It started me thinking about the experiences of the lady whose home was
                    located
                    right on the front line of the battle between the 1st British Airborne Division and assorted
                    German
                    forces.</p>

                <p>My “pandemic project” has now grown into a collection of over 6,000 postal items sent throughout
                    Holland
                    during the five years of war (1940-1945). Clearly, not all items within our collection are specific
                    to
                    Arnhem nor do they all fall within the time frame of the battle, but many of them contribute to an
                    understanding of a Dutch population enduring one of the most fierce battles of the Second World War
                    as
                    it
                    was acted out in their homes and gardens.</p>
