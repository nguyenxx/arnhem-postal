            <h1> Featured exhibits </h1>
            <p> Select material from the collection has been used to create a series of philatelic exhibits looking
                at the impact of World War 2 in Holland, focusing on the war’s impact on the civilian
                population. Each exhibit consists of forty (40) tabloid pages and includes both philatelic and
                other original artifacts, organized around a central theme. The first exhibit “The Evolution of
                the Holocaust in Holland” looks at the Nazi’s increasingly harsh measures against the Jewish
                population that ended in the death camps of Auschwitz and Sobibor. The second exhibit “False
                Hopes and Lasting Thanks” examines the impact of Operation Market Garden. Three further
                exhibits are currently in production, “Code Name Yellow: 1940 - Invasion and Occupation of
                Holland”, “Daily Life in Occupied Holland”, and “The Hunger Winter and Liberation”.</p>

                                This exhibit shows in detail how the destruction of the Jewish population in Holland
                                evolved
                                from pre-war Refugee Camps through a series of Transit and Concentration Camps to the

                                chambers of Auschwitz and Sobibor. Using contemporaneous correspondence and related
                                documents, the exhibit shows the clear progression from collection to internment and on
                                to
                                deportation to the “East”, ultimately resulting in the death of over 105,000 Dutch Jews.

                                and British combatants whose lives intersected for ten days in Arnhem and the surrounding

                                Poland in September of 1939. Despite the Dutch’s longstanding policy of neutrality, the invasion
                                of Holland began when German troops crossed the border in the pre-dawn hours of Friday,
                                May 10th, 1940 under Operation FALL GELB (Case Yellow). Only five days later the Nazis
                                controlled the entire country except for a small area of Zeeland in the southwest. Zeeland
                                would also soon fall.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After the disastrous Operation Market Garden, the Netherlands was divided between liberated
                                areas in the south and those still occupied by the Germans in the north. As an unusually cold
                                winter began in 1944/45, the Germans introduced a series of restrictive measures, intended as
                                punishment for Dutch support, especially among rail workers, of the Allies during Operation
                                Market Garden. Dutch civilians in occupied areas were cut off from food supplies and forced to
                                survive on restricted rations, resulting in mass starvation and hypothermia. Meanwhile in the
                                liberated areas, people were searching for family members displaced by the fighting and any
                                news of those still living in occupied areas.</p>
