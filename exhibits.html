                        Germany invaded Holland on May 10, 1940 and the majority of Dutch forces surrendered 4
                        days later on May 14, 1940. During 1940, the German occupation authorities banned Jews
                        from the civil service and required Jews to register the assets of their business
                        enterprises. In January 1941, the German authorities required all Jews to register
                        themselves. A total of 159,806 persons registered, including 19,561 persons born of
                        mixed marriages. The total included some 25,000 Jewish refugees from the German Reich. A
                        Jewish council was established in February 1941 and in the same month the first “razzia”
                        or roundup of young Jewish men took place. From May 3, 1942 it became obligatory for
                        Jewish citizens over the age of 6 to wear the Star of David. Jewish businesses were
                        boycotted and vandalized. </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        This exhibit shows in detail how the destruction of the Jewish population in Holland
                        evolved from pre-war Refugee Camps through a series of Transit and Concentration Camps
                        to the gas chambers of Auschwitz and Sobibor. Using contemporaneous correspondence and
                        related documents, the exhibit shows the clear progression from collection to internment
                        and on to deportation to the “East”, ultimately resulting in the death of over 105,000
                        Dutch Jews. The vast majority of these Dutch civilians were interred at Transit Camp
                        Westerbork, before being sent on weekly trains to their deaths. More than 100,000 Jewish
                        persons spent time in Camp Westerbork. There were only 876 survivors left at Camp
                        Westerbork when the camp was liberated in April 1945.

                    <p class="card-text">On September 17, the First Allied Airborne Army and XXX Corps of the
                        Second British Army launched Operation Market Garden, the largest airborne operation of
                        the war. Its objective was the creation of a bridgehead, stretching from the Belgian
                        border and over the Rhine River, covering a distance of 64 mi (103 Km), thereby
                        providing an invasion route into Northern Germany. U.S. and British airborne forces were
                        to simultaneously capture and hold 9 bridges across 6 major waterways while the British
                        Second Army would swiftly follow overland and secure the invasion route. </p>
                    <p class="card-text">The Battle of Arnhem was fought in and around the Dutch city of Arnhem
                        and the
                        neighboring villages of Oosterbeek, Wolfheze, Renkum and Driel. The first elements of
                        the 1st Airborne Division landed at midday on 17 September 1944, some 8 miles (13 km)
                        from its objectives, the road and rail bridges. At first the troops made excellent
                        progress, being welcomed as liberators by the jubilant Dutch civilians. However, its
                        advance towards the road and railway bridges was hampered by unexpected resistance,
                        especially from elements of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Only a small force of approximately 750 men was able to reach the Arnhem road bridge.
                        The advance of the main body of the division was stopped on the outskirts of the town.
                        XXX Corps was unable to advance north from Nijmegen as quickly as planned and after four
                        days, the small British force at the bridge was overwhelmed and what was left of the
                        division became trapped in a small pocket in Oosterbeek, just north of the river.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        After nine days of fighting, the remnants of the division were withdrawn across the
                        Rhine in Operation Berlin. The 1st Airborne Division lost nearly three quarters of its
                        strength and did not see combat again. The Allies were unable to advance further with no
                        secure bridges over the Rhine and the front line stabilized south of Arnhem, extending
                        the war in the North of Holland for another 8 months. This split between north and south
                        severed postal and other connections. Despite its defeat, the battle of the British 1st
                        Airborne Division at Arnhem has become the stuff of legends and the subject of numerous
                        books, as well as the popular film “A Bridge Too Far.”</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Dutch Foreign Policy had always favored neutrality, doing what it could
                        to avoid conflicts outside its borders. This approach had been successful during the
                        First World War and the government went to great lengths not to antagonize the Nazi
                        regime. However, this time this neutral approach did not work. </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 and Denmark and Norway in
                        April 1940, the Dutch hastily undertook a general mobilization. All leave was canceled
                        and the Dutch government declared Martial Law on April 9th, 1940. However, German troops
                        crossed the Dutch border in the pre-dawn hours of Friday, May 10th, 1940 as part of a
                        larger campaign (Code Yellow) to secure the Low Lands, including Belgium and Luxembourg,
                        thereby denying the British a foothold on the European mainland.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Dutch forces were no match for the Germans and they were forced to surrender after just
                        five days. Queen Wilhelmina fled to England on a British warship and though she was
                        strongly criticized at the time, she soon became a potent symbol of the fight against
                        Germany. (Available Spring 2024).</p>

                        years, from May 1940 through May 1945. This exhibit and collection will focus on the
                        lives of the Dutch people under occupation and the impact on their daily lives of the
                        increasingly stringent regulations enforced by the Nazis. Topics explored will include
                        censorship, rationing, resistance and forced labor. (Available Winter 2024).</p>

                    <p class="card-text">After the failure of Operation Market Garden, the Netherlands was
                        divided between liberated areas in the south and those still occupied by the Germans in
                        the north. As an unusually cold winter began, the Germans reacted to Dutch railway
                        strikes in support of the Allies and civilians in occupied areas were cut off from food
                        supplies and forced to survive on restricted rations, resulting in starvation and
                        hypothermia. In liberated areas, people were busily trying to put their lives back
                        together, while searching for family members and news of those still living under
                        occupation. (Available Winter 2024).</p>

                                from its objectives, the road and rail bridges. At first the troops made excellent
                                progress, being welcomed as liberators by the jubilant Dutch civilians. However, its
                                advance towards the road and railway bridges was hampered by unexpected resistance,
                                especially from elements of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions.</p>

                                Only a small force of approximately 750 men was able to reach the Arnhem road bridge.
                                The advance of the main body of the division was stopped on the outskirts of the town.
                                XXX Corps was unable to advance north from Nijmegen as quickly as planned and after four
                                days, the small British force at the bridge was overwhelmed and what was left of the
                                division became trapped in a small pocket in Oosterbeek, just north of the river.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">
                                After nine days of fighting, the remnants of the division were withdrawn across the
                                Rhine in Operation Berlin. The 1st Airborne Division lost nearly three quarters of its
                                strength and did not see combat again. The Allies were unable to advance further with no
                                secure bridges over the Rhine and the front line stabilized south of Arnhem, extending
                                the war in the North of Holland for another 8 months. This split between north and south
                                severed postal and other connections. Despite its defeat, the battle of the British 1st
                                Airborne Division at Arnhem has become the stuff of legends and the subject of numerous
                                books, as well as the popular film “A Bridge Too Far.”</p>

                                to avoid conflicts outside its borders. This approach had been successful during the
                                First World War and the government went to great lengths not to antagonize the Nazi
                                regime. However, this time this neutral approach did not work. </p>

                                Following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 and Denmark and Norway in
                                April 1940, the Dutch hastily undertook a general mobilization. All leave was canceled
                                and the Dutch government declared Martial Law on April 9th, 1940. However, German troops
                                crossed the Dutch border in the pre-dawn hours of Friday, May 10th, 1940 as part of a
                                larger campaign (Code Yellow) to secure the Low Lands, including Belgium and Luxembourg,
                                thereby denying the British a foothold on the European mainland.</p>

                                Dutch forces were no match for the Germans and they were forced to surrender after just
                                five days. Queen Wilhelmina fled to England on a British warship and though she was
                                strongly criticized at the time, she soon became a potent symbol of the fight against
                                Germany. (Available Spring 2024).</p>

                                the north. As an unusually cold winter began, the Germans reacted to Dutch railway
                                strikes in support of the Allies and civilians in occupied areas were cut off from food
                                supplies and forced to survive on restricted rations, resulting in starvation and
                                hypothermia. In liberated areas, people were busily trying to put their lives back
                                together, while searching for family members and news of those still living under
                                occupation. (Available Winter 2024).</p>
