                    <p>This display exhibit uses philatelic artifacts and contemporary material to document the
                        destruction of the Jewish population in Holland. The Holocaust in Holland evolved from
                        pre-war Refugee Camps through a series of Transit and Concentration Camps to the gas
                        chambers of Auschwitz and Sobibor. It includes examples of mail sent to and from the camps
                        and tells the personal, harrowing stories of a few who survived and the more than 105,000
                        Dutch Jews that perished. </p>
                    <p>The exhibit shows the progression from arrest to internment and finally to deportation “to
                        the East”. The vast majority of these civilians were interned at Transit Camp Westerbork
                        before being sent to their deaths.</p>

                    <h2> Development and Historical Context </h2>
                    <p> On May 17, 1938 the Dutch Minister of Justice issued an order that refugees would no longer be
                        granted residence permits. After Kristallnacht (Night of the Broken Glass) in Germany on
                        November 9, 1938 Holland no longer admitted new refugees from Germany. In early 1939 a permanent
                        Central Refugee Camp, Westerbork, was established in the small village of Hooghalen. Germany
                        invaded Holland on May 10, 1940. They banned Jews from the civil service and required that they
                        declare their business assets. In January 1941, all Jewish persons were ordered to register and
                        159,806 individuals complied, including 19,561 persons born of mixed marriages. The total
                        included some 25,000 Jewish refugees from the German Reich. In February 1941 the first “razzia”
                        or roundup of young Jewish men took place. </p>

                <div class="col-lg-8">
                    <p>Camp Westerbork continued to operate as a Refugee Camp until July 1, 1942, when the
                        responsibility for the camp’s operation was taken over by the Befehlhaber der Sicherheitspolizei
                        und der SD. Camp Westerbork ceased to be a Refugee Camp and became Durchgangslager Westerbork,
                        Transit Camp Westerbork where Jews were held before being sent “to the East”. They were told
                        that they would work for the Germans, but this was difficult to believe as the transports
                        included children and the elderly, as well as the physically and mentally ill. However, no one
                        yet knew the full extent of the terrible fate that awaited them. Transports from Camp Westerbork
                        ended in September 1944 and the camp was finally liberated by Canadian forces on April 12, 1945.
                        Only 876 inmates were found alive. </p>

                    <p> Between 1934 and 1942 thirty-six young Jews, intending to emigrate to Palestine, were educated
                        at a farm in Weerselo in the Dutch Province of Overijssel. These so-called Palestine Pioneers
                        were preparing for a life of farming on kibbutzes. Among them were several young Jewish refugees
                        from German. One of them was Willi Weinberg, who had been born in Oelde, Germany on September
                        21, 1911. He stayed at the farm in Overijssel from October 1936 until July 1937. In January 1938
                        he married Margrete Grünebaum in Amsterdam. </p>

                        Censorship Internment Camp Norg. Norg is a village in the Drenthe province. It was the location

                        poorly. The camp was to closed on January 3, 1939, and the inmates transferred to
                        Hellevoetsluis. The C.I.N. censorship stamp was taken from Norg to Hellevoetsluis. <span

                        concerned with assisting baptized Jews. Two camps were established in Sluis (Province of

                        non-Catholics in the former boarding school St. Joseph. In contrast with the four official
                        camps, residents of these independent camps were able to enjoy freedom of movement and their

                    <p>On May 13, 1939, the German ocean liner S.S. St. Louis set sail from Hamburg to Cuba with 936
                        Jewish German refugees on board. They considered themselves to be the fortunate ones who had
                        been able to obtain Cuban visas. The majority had applied for USA visas and wanted to await the
                        outcome in Cuba. The passengers were unaware that corrupt immigration officials had Cuban
                        President Laredo Bru declare all visas invalid. Hostility towards immigrants and anti-Semitism
                        undoubtedly played a role.</p>
                    <p>
                        When the ship docked in Havana on May 26, 1939, only 22 refugees were allowed to disembark. To
                        their disbelief, all other passengers had to remain on board. Among them were Walter and Hilde
                        Velman. All efforts by Captain Gustav Schröder to help the refugees were in vain. On June 2, the
                        St. Louis was ordered to leave Cuban waters. Personal pleas to President Roosevelt to provide
                        refuge were unanswered, and the ship returned to pre-war Europe, arriving on June 6, 1939.

                        The passengers were not returned to Germany. Jewish organizations negotiated with four European
                        governments to admit the refugees. Entry visas were finally provided by Great Britain (288), the
                        Netherlands (181), Belgium (214) and France (224). The 181 refugees accepted by the Dutch
                        government were initially housed in Rotterdam and then after six weeks they were transferred to
                        Westerbork, at that point still a refugee camp.
