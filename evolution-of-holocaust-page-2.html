                <h2> The Indies Hostages </h2>
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <p>After the Dutch surrender to the Germans in May 1940, the Dutch East Indies remained free and
                        unoccupied. German citizens living in the colony were arrested and interned to the outrage of
                        German
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>In retaliation, 400 Dutchmen were arrested in Holland. They became known as the Indische
                        Gijzelaars, the Indies Hostages. The Germans hoped that by arresting people who were on leave
                        from
                        the colony or had close ties with it, they would ensure proper treatment of the German
                        internees.
                        For this reason, the Indies Hostages were relatively well treated. Unlike the majority of
                        civilian
                        prisoners, they were allowed to receive Red Cross parcels, clothes and blankets. The Dutch
                        hostages
                        were initially taken to Zivilkonzentrationslager Buchenwald, but in November 1941, they were
                        moved
                        to Haarendael Major Seminary in the town of Haaren. They were then moved to Beekvliet Minor
                        Seminary
                        in St. Michielsgestel and then to a boarding school for boys called De Ruwenberg before finally
                        being sent to Camp Vught. Camp Haaren became the generic name for the three Dutch locations
                        where
                        the hostages were held.</p>

                    <p>In 1942, another group of hostages, civilian internees, were interned at Beekvliet. They were
                        well-known scientists, politicians, government officials and artists. The Germans expected to
                        use these additional hostages to deter the Dutch underground from acts of resistance. Thus,
                        these internees were referred to as “anti-resistance hostages:” However, when the resistance
                        nevertheless carried out an attack on a Nazi troop train outside Rotterdam, the Germans executed
                        five of these hostages on August 15, 1942.</p>

                        Borne, some 50 km southeast of Zwolle, on Wednesday, November 15, 1944, and because it is dated
                        “Tuesday” on the card, he probably started writing it the day before. Brehm addressed the card
                        to his family in Rotterdam.</p>

                        <p>Well Alie, it is as I said. At the moment we are approaching the German border, so you know
                            what is going on. Nasty isn’t it. But there is nothing that one can do about it. Let us hope
                            for the best. I probably won’t be home now until after the war. If only we end up in one
                            piece. Give my regards to everyone. Ignore the handwriting. We are writing in the freight
                            train, and then we will throw it out. </p>

                        <p>While in the Fair Building (Utrecht) I was asked about my profession I had. My answer was
                            insufficient for my release… The German Major said: I have made a decidision and that is
                            “labor”. We left at 11:30AM and arrived in the infamous Camp Amersfoort at 5:00AM. Although
                            I know that you will try everything possible, I don’t think that you will get me released. I
                            only hope that I survive... Say hi to the boys, and thank Mrs. Kloche for her kindness. I
                            accidentally kept the keys to the safe in my pocket. </p>

                    <p>It is clear that the sender, T. Kruijff, had this card with him in case he was arrested. It was
                        thrown from the train en route from Camp Amersfoort and picked up and delivered after being
                        found alongside the tracks. The stamp is not canceled, and it was delivered outside the postal
                        system. He also added in pencil “ik ben opgepakt”, "I have been arrested." Then he added one
                        more note at the bottom: a co-victim asked that his wife be notified and that all is fine so
                        far.</p>
